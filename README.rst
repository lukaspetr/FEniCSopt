FEniCSopt
--------

This program covers our optimization techniques in FEM,
it is written mainly in FEniCS and scipy.
For further details look at scripts at scripts directory.

I do not recommend using the setup.py to install the FEniCSopt package directly,
under many different circumstances it could be better to rather put the files from the
scripts folder directly on the upper level. Then you can just run them, they see
the libraries in lower levels.
